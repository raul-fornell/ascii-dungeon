# Ascii Dungeon

Dungeon generator in plain javascript. This is an experiment of a micro game with functional programming and classes just for data structures.

The graphics engine is just ascii symbols. 

## How to run

Start a local server with something like

```bash
npx http-server
```

And visit the URL.

## How to play

Click anywhere on the screen to set the focus to the browser and move the hero (a dot) with the arrow keys of the keyboard. Notice this doesn't work on a touch device.

There is no goal, only walls and doors.

## Nice to have

* Add enemies
* Add items to carry, keys for example
* Block doors that open with keys
