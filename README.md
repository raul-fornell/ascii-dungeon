# Ascii Dungeon

Dungeon generator in plain javascript. This is an experiment of a micro game with functional programming and classes just for data structures.

The graphics engine is just ascii symbols. 

## How to play

Just give the focus to the browser and move the hero (a dot) with the arrow keys of the keyboard. Notice this doesn't work on a touch device.

There is no goal, just walls and doors.

## Road map

* Add enemies
* Add items to carry, keys for example
* Block doors that open with keys
